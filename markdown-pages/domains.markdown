#description List of alternative domain names

This is the current list of available alternative domain names.  Some
important notes first:

 - You can always use your own domain name too, just follow the
   instructions on the [features](/features.html) page
 - These domains won't be available forever, so don't rely on them for
   too long
 - They probably will not be renewed after a year, but new domains
   will be activated
 - If you have an idea for a domain name please
   [send me](/contact.html) the name so I can buy it

So the rule of thumb is, if you plan to use an email for years, use
@mailnesia.com, if you just need a quick address then forget about it,
use these alternate names.

 - volatile.site
 - ephemeral.fun
