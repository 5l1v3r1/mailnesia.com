#title Translation
#description Information about the translation of the site.

If the site is not available in your native language, you can
contribute with a translation - it will be greatly appreciated !

The process is fairly simple, I prepared a [Google Docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArXaEexy-UBldGZyaGFyVVNzM3lwbDRJWTRHNmp1Ync)
with all the messages, words and pages in the available languages, you
just have to make a new column with your language.  Or if the
translation is already started in your language, just fill in the
missing cells.  Also, if you feel that a translation is inaccurate,
just replace the cell with a better version.  You can contribute with
a single phrase or whole pages, it's up to you!

In the spreadsheet the expressions `_x` and `_y` will be replaced by something, it can be
figured out from the context. For example, `page _x` it will be the
page number, `Mail for _y:` will be the mailbox name you enter in the
form etc.  The `ยง` character is a text separator.

If you translate a whole column or page, you have a place on the
[Thanks to](/thanksto.html) hall of fame, along with a link to your
website (if you [send](/contact.html) your name and/or the URL after the translation).
Thanks for reading this!
