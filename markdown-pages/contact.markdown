#description Contact me with problems on the site, suggestions, feature requests.

Please check the [features](/features.html) and
[frequently asked questions](/FAQ.html) pages first to see if your
question has already been answered.

You can contact me *in English*:

* If you encounter any problems on the site, or if you have
  suggestions, feature requests then open an issue on [GitHub][GH].
* By [submitting a question][AMA] on the blog.  It is also possible to
  ask anonymously but in this case the only way to answer is by
  publicly making a post on the blog unless you leave an email address
  to reply to.
